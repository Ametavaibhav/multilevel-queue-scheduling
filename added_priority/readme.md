Added priorities to the processes.
Student processes are given priority 1 and teacher processes are given priority 0 and teacher processes are handled first.
Also added the time constraint so the user will be able to access the program if the time is between 10AM-12AM.
(!! To access the program just uncomment the return 0 line in the main function . !!)
